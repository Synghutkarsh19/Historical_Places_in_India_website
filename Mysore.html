            Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence (house). It is
            located in Mysore, Karnataka. It used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of
            the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore
            is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one. However, the
            Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new fort. </div>

        The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). Yaduraya built
        the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times.
        The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, bricks
        and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the
        current structure is also known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist attractions in
        India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than six million annual visitors. <br><br> </div>
