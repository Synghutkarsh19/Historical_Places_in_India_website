            The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the
            edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

                The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai
                Singh, the
                founder of the city of Jaipur, India. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that
                he
                built this grand and historical palace.

        It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows
        called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow
        royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since
        they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them to appear in public without face coverings.
        This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole
        area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view
        and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.

        In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, to give a facelift to the
        monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568 million. The corporate sector lent a hand to preserve the historical
        monuments of Jaipur and the Unit Trust of India has adopted Hawa Mahal to maintain it.[7] The palace is an
        extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements, and arched roofs are some of the
        features of this popular tourist spot. The monument also has delicately modelled hanging cornices. <br><br><br>
