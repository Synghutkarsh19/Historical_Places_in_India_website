            The Golden Temple (also known as the Harmandir Sahib, lit. 'abode of God', Punjabi pronunciation:
            [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ], or the Darbār Sahib, 'exalted court', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ]) is a gurdwara
            located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism. It is
            one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur, and
            Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib. <br><br>

        The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in
        1577. In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib. The Gurdwara was
        repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by
        the Mughal and invading Afghan armies. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire,
        rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to
        the name the Golden Temple.

        The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh Sabha
        Movement between 1883 and 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s, the
        Gurdwara became a centre of conflict between the Indian government and a movement led by Jarnail Singh
        Bhindranwale. In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star,
        leading to deaths of over 1,000 soldiers and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the Gurdwara and the
        destruction of Akal Takht. The Gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage. </div>

        The Golden Temple is an open house of worship for all people, from all walks of life and faiths. It has a
        square plan with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around the pool. The four entrances to the
        gurudwara symbolises the Sikh belief in equality and the Sikh view that all people are welcome into their holy
        place. The complex is a collection of buildings around the sanctum and the pool. One of these is Akal
        Takht, the chief centre of religious authority of Sikhism. Additional buildings include a clock tower, the
        offices of the Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar – a free Sikh community–run kitchen that offers a
        vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination. Over 150,000 people visit the holy shrine everyday
        for worship. The Gurdwara complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is
        pending on the tentative list of UNESCO. <br><br><br>
